## Task 2 - Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

### ✨ Objective:
Use pre-trained generative models (like Stable Diffusion via Hugging Face) to generate images from natural language text prompts.

### 🛠️ Technologies:
- Python
- Hugging Face Diffusers
- Transformers
- Google Colab

### 📷 Sample Prompts:
- "A futuristic city under a sunset"
- "A cute cat astronaut in space"

### ✅ Output:
The notebook uses Stable Diffusion to generate images from input prompts and saves them locally.

### 📁 Files:
- `task2_stable_diffusion.ipynb`: Colab code for generation
- Generated sample images
